Clinical data collected included gender, age, smoking history, Tumor-Node-Metastases (TNM) staging system, pathologic types, laboratory parameters, and PET metabolic parameters. Four machine learning algorithms-Bayes, logistic, random forest, and Supportsupport vector machine (SVM)-were used to build models. The predictive performance was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses identified independent predictors of OS and PFS in PD-L1-positive expression patients undergoing immunotherapy, and a nomogram was created to predict OS.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">A total of 20 models were built for predicting PD-L1 expression. The clinical combined PET/CT radiomics model based on the SVM algorithm performed best (area under curve for training and test sets: 0.914 and 0.877, respectively). The Cox analyses showed that smoking history independently predicted PFS. SUVmean, monocyte percentage and white blood cell count were independent predictors of OS, and the nomogram was created to predict 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS based on these three factors.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">We developed PET/CT-based machine learning models to help predict PD-L1 expression in NSCLC patients and identified independent predictors of PFS and OS in PD-L1-positive patients receiving immunotherapy, thereby aiding precision treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#xa9; 2025.
