To better understand vulnerabilities within the healthcare sector and develop preventive measures, it is crucial to examine the evolving nature of cyberthreats and the types of attacks occurring. In this article, we describe a multimethod approach comprising social networks analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning, using data from GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone), to identify the prevalence of attacks on hospitals while considering the type of attack and its date. Through this approach, meaningful patterns in the evolution of cyberattacks are revealed by analyzing the relationships between emerging cyberattacks mentioned in news reports. Findings show that the number of attacks from 2017 to 2023 increased substantially, with hospitals being more prone to critical attacks such as cyberterrorism/state actor-sponsored criminal activities, advanced persistent threats, and distributed denial of service. Mapping real-time data from diverse sources using a multimethod approach, such as the framework proposed in this article, can lead to better understanding of the threat landscape. This is a crucial step in determining necessary cyberdefenses and informing the development of policy interventions to ensure the cybersecurity of critical national infrastructure.</AbstractText></Abstract><AuthorList CompleteYN="Y"><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Piazza</LastName><ForeName>Anna</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials><Identifier Source="ORCID">0000-0002-5785-6948</Identifier><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Anna Piazza, PhD, is a Senior Lecturer in Economic Sociology, and Srinidhi Vasudevan, PhD, is a Senior Lecturer in Business Management; both in the School Business, Operations and Strategy, University of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author><Author ValidYN="Y"><LastName>Vasudevan</LastName><ForeName>Srinidhi</ForeName><Initials>S</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Anna Piazza, PhD, is a Senior Lecturer in Economic Sociology, and Srinidhi Vasudevan, PhD, is a Senior Lecturer in Business Management; both in the School Business, Operations and Strategy, University of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom.</Affiliation></AffiliationInfo></Author></AuthorList><Language>eng</Language><PublicationTypeList><PublicationType UI="D016428">Journal Article</PublicationType></PublicationTypeList><ArticleDate DateType="Electronic"><Year>2025</Year><Month>05</Month><Day>16</Day></ArticleDate></Article><MedlineJournalInfo><Country>United States</Country><MedlineTA>Health Secur</MedlineTA><NlmUniqueID>101654694</NlmUniqueID><ISSNLinking>2326-5094</ISSNLinking></MedlineJournalInfo><CitationSubset>IM</CitationSubset><KeywordList Owner="NOTNLM"><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Critical national infrastructure (CNI)</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Cyberattacks</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Cyberthreat landscape</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">GDELT</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Hospitals</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Machine learning</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Natural language processing</Keyword><Keyword MajorTopicYN="N">Social networks analysis</Keyword></KeywordList></MedlineCitation><PubmedData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2025</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>11</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2025</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>11</Hour><Minute>42</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2025</Year><Month>5</Month><Day>16</Day><Hour>4</Hour><Minute>43</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>aheadofprint</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">40376742</ArticleId><ArticleId IdType="doi">10.1089/hs.2024.0016</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedData></PubmedArticle></PubmedArticleSet>
