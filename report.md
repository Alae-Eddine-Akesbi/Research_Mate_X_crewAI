# Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Review of Current Research

This report reviews recent research on machine learning (ML) applications in healthcare, focusing on a case study investigating dental faculty perceptions of AI integration and broader trends within the field.

## Dental Faculty Perceptions of AI Integration: A Case Study

A mixed-methods study (Abdullah et al., 2025) examined the awareness, knowledge, and attitudes of 400 Pakistani dental faculty members toward AI integration in dental education and practice.  The study employed a modified General Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) and focus group discussions (FGDs).

### Key Findings:

* **Awareness and Knowledge:** While most faculty demonstrated awareness of AI's general applications, knowledge of specific ML techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, was limited (less than 20%).  Colleagues and social media were the primary sources of AI information.
* **Attitudes:** Faculty exhibited a generally positive attitude toward AI (mean GAAIS score: 3.5, SD ± 0.61), acknowledging its potential benefits.
* **Barriers to Adoption:**  The study identified significant barriers to AI adoption, including:
    1. Financial constraints
    2. Lack of AI training opportunities
    3. Ethical concerns regarding data management and academic integrity.
* **Recommendations:** The study recommended targeted educational initiatives, interdisciplinary collaborations, promotion of local AI technology development, and supportive policy changes to facilitate AI integration in dental education and practice.

### Methodology:

The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis (using SPSS) and qualitative thematic analysis of FGD transcripts (using Otter.ai). This approach enabled a comprehensive understanding of faculty perceptions.


## Broader Trends in Machine Learning in Healthcare

Beyond the dental context, ML applications in healthcare demonstrate several key trends:

* **Improved Diagnostics:** ML algorithms are increasingly used for disease diagnosis, often surpassing human experts in specific areas (Obermeyer & Emanuel, 2016). Examples include image analysis for cancer detection (Fatima et al., 2020) and periodontal disease diagnosis (Farhadian et al., 2020).
* **Personalized Medicine:** ML facilitates the development of personalized treatment plans by analyzing individual patient data and predicting treatment outcomes (Nguyen et al., 2021).
* **Drug Discovery and Development:** ML accelerates drug discovery by identifying potential drug candidates and predicting their efficacy (Boreak, 2020).
* **Robotic Surgery:** ML enhances robotic surgery by improving precision and reducing invasiveness (Schwendicke et al., 2023).
* **Challenges and Limitations:** Despite the potential benefits, significant challenges persist:
    1. **Data Availability and Quality:** High-quality, labeled data is crucial for training effective ML models.
    2. **Algorithm Bias and Fairness:** ML algorithms can inherit biases from training data, potentially leading to healthcare disparities.
    3. **Ethical Concerns:**  Data privacy, patient autonomy, and algorithmic transparency require careful consideration.
    4. **Regulatory Hurdles:** The regulatory landscape for AI in healthcare is still evolving.


## Future Directions

Future research should address the identified challenges and expand ML applications to a wider range of healthcare problems. This includes developing robust and explainable ML models, mitigating algorithmic bias, and establishing ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment. Integrating AI into healthcare education is crucial to prepare future healthcare professionals for the evolving field.
