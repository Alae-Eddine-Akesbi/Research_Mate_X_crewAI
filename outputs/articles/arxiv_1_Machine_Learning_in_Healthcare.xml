    <ns0:title>Machine Learning Applications In Healthcare: The State Of Knowledge and
  Future Directions</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Detection of easily missed hidden patterns with fast processing power makes
machine learning (ML) indispensable to today's healthcare system. Though many
ML applications have already been discovered and many are still under
investigation, only a few have been adopted by current healthcare systems. As a
result, there exists an enormous opportunity in healthcare system for ML but
distributed information, scarcity of properly arranged and easily explainable
documentation in related sector are major impede which are making ML
applications difficult to healthcare professionals. This study aimed to gather
ML applications in different areas of healthcare concisely and more effectively
so that necessary information can be accessed immediately with relevant
references. We divided our study into five major groups: community level work,
risk management/ preventive care, healthcare operation management, remote care,
and early detection. Dividing these groups into subgroups, we provided relevant
references with description in tabular form for quick access. Our objective is
to inform people about ML applicability in healthcare industry, reduce the
knowledge gap of clinicians about the ML applications and motivate healthcare
professionals towards more machine learning based healthcare system.
