    <ns0:title>Reliable and Resilient AI and IoT-based Personalised Healthcare
  Services: A Survey</ns0:title>
    <ns0:summary>  Recent technological and economic developments have transformed the
healthcare sector towards more personalized and IoT-based healthcare services.
These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that
are typically developed using artificial intelligence/machine learning-based
algorithms, which play a significant role in highlighting the efficiency of
traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are
dedicated to a specific environment to support technological personalization.
However, they are unable to consider different interrelated health conditions,
leading to inappropriate diagnoses and affecting sustainability and the
long-term health of patients. To this end, current Healthcare 5.0 technology
has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of
healthcare 5.0 is to achieve an autonomous healthcare service, that takes into
account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services.
In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of
comprehensive personalized healthcare services in modern healthcare Internet of
Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use
case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a
fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using AI
and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by
their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare
services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer
of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions.
Finally, we propose a methodology to develop reliable, resilient, and
personalized healthcare services that address the identified weaknesses of
existing approaches.
