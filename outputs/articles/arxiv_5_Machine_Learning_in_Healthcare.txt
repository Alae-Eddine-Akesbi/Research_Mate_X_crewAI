Title: SoK: Security and Privacy Risks of Healthcare AI

Summary:   The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
into healthcare systems holds great promise for enhancing patient care and care
delivery efficiency; however, it also exposes sensitive data and system
integrity to potential cyberattacks. Current security and privacy (S&P)
research on healthcare AI is highly unbalanced in terms of healthcare
deployment scenarios and threat models, and has a disconnected focus with the
biomedical research community. This hinders a comprehensive understanding of
the risks that healthcare AI entails. To address this gap, this paper takes a
thorough examination of existing healthcare AI S&P research, providing a
unified framework that allows the identification of under-explored areas. Our
survey presents a systematic overview of healthcare AI attacks and defenses,
and points out challenges and research opportunities for each AI-driven
healthcare application domain. Through our experimental analysis of different
threat models and feasibility studies on under-explored adversarial attacks, we
provide compelling insights into the pressing need for cybersecurity research
in the rapidly evolving field of healthcare AI.
